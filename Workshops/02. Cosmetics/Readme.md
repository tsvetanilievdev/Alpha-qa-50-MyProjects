## OOP Workshop - Cosmetics Shop 2

### Description
The shop already has a working Engine. You do not have to touch anything in it. Just use it.

There should be three types of products, Shampoos, Creams and Toothpastes. 
- Each Shampoo has **name, brand, price, gender, milliliters, usage**. 
- Each Toothpaste has **name, brand, price, gender, ingredients**.
- Each Cream has **name, brand, price, gender**.

There is also Categories.

- Categories have a **name and a list of products**.

### Task
Your **task** is to **design an object-oriented class hierarchy** to model the cosmetics shop, **using the best practices for object-oriented programming** (OOP). 
Encapsulate correctly all fields and use validation whenever needed.

#### 1. ShampooImpl 
- Extends ProductBase
- It has name, brand, price, gender, milliliters, usage
- Minimum shampoo name’s length is 3 symbols and maximum is 10 symbols.
- Minimum shampoo brand name’s length is 2 symbols and maximum is 10 symbols.
- Price cannot be negative.
- Gender type can be **"Men"**, **"Women"** or **"Unisex"**.
- Milliliters are not negative number
- Usage type can be **"EveryDay"** or **"Medical"**

#### 2. ToothpasteImpl
- Extends ProductBase
- It has name, brand, price, gender, ingredients
- Minimum toothpaste name’s length is 3 symbols and maximum is 10 symbols.
- Minimum toothpaste brand name’s length is 2 symbols and maximum is 10 symbols.
- Price cannot be negative.
- Gender type can be **"Men"**, **"Women"** or **"Unisex"**.

#### 3. CreamImpl
- Extends ProductBase
- It has name, brand, price, gender, scent
- Minimum cream name’s length is 3 symbols and maximum is 10 symbols.
- Minimum cream brand name’s length is 2 symbols and maximum is 10 symbols.
- Price cannot be negative.
- Gender type can be **"Men"**, **"Women"** or **"Unisex"**.
- Scent type can be **"Rose"**, **"Lavender"** or **"Vanilla"**.

#### 4. CategoryImpl
- It has name, products
- Minimum category name’s length is 2 symbols and maximum is 15 symbols.

### Constraints
- Look into the example below to get better understanding of the printing format.
- All double number type fields should be printed with formatting **0.00** as in the example output.
- If a null value is passed to some mandatory property, your program should throw a proper exception.

### Additional notes
- To simplify your work you are given an already built execution engine that executes a sequence of commands read from the console using the classes and interfaces in your project (see the Cosmetics-Skeleton folder).
- Please, look the classes in **cosmetics.models** package. You do not need to create new classes!

### Unit Tests

You are given unit tests to keep track of your progress.

## Step by step guide

> *Hint**: You don't need to take care of the Engine class and the Main method but of course you could try to understand how they work.

> *Hint*: Run the Unit tests whenever you finish a task.

**1.** You are given a skeleton of the Cosmetics shop.
 Please take a look at it carefully before you try to do anything. 
 Try to understand all the classes and interfaces in **cosmetics.models** package and how they work. (You should not touch the other packages at all).

**2.** Build the project and run some commands. The following exceptions will tell you where features 
should be implemented.

**3.** Validate all the fields. Yes, again :)

**4.** Did you notice the repeating code in the ShampooImpl, CreamImpl and ToothpasteImpl classes. What should you do in ProductBase class?

**5.** Implement **print()** methods (there are print() methods in the Product and Category interfaces).

#### **Hint**: Use the Unit tests when you finish the task.
